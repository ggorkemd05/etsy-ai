"""Output you can screenshot without exposing your shop.

CLI output gets shared far more often than anyone plans for, and a listing title is
enough to find the shop it belongs to on Etsy. `--anonymise` keeps the findings
readable and drops the identity.

Every value below is invented. Test data must never carry a real shop's name, ids or
vocabulary — a public test file is a fingerprint, and this file of all files should
not be one.
