"""Reading the clipboard, with no third-party dependency.

`stallkit init --from-clipboard` exists so a secret can go from the page you copied
it on straight into your `.env`, without passing through your shell history, your
screen, or anyone helping you set the tool up.

The value is never printed. Callers get the string and are expected to keep it that
way — everything in stallkit reports a length, never a secret.
