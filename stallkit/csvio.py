"""CSV helpers.

Sellers edit these files in Excel, Numbers or Google Sheets, so we read and write
UTF-8 with a BOM — without it Excel on Windows mangles accented characters, which
matters when your titles are in Turkish, German or French.

Multi-value cells (tags, materials, image paths) use '|' rather than ',' so that a
tag containing a comma survives a round trip through a spreadsheet.
