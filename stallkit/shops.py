"""Several Etsy shops on one computer.

Each shop is a home of its own: its `.env` with the app keys, its token, its Pin
queue, its window preferences. The first shop is the base home itself
(`~/.stallkit`), exactly where a single-shop install has always kept everything, so
nothing moves for anyone with one shop. Further shops live in `~/.stallkit/shops/<id>/`
and are selected with STALLKIT_SHOP or the `--shop` option.

Etsy ties an OAuth token to one Etsy account, and one account has one shop, so two
shops means two sign-ins — and a home per shop is what keeps them apart.
