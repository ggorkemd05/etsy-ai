"""The setup checklist: work out exactly what is missing, and say what to do about it.

Most of the friction in a tool like this is not the code — it is the eight things
that must all be true before a single request can succeed. Some can be detected, some
can only be asked, and the difference matters: a check that quietly assumes is worse
than one that asks.

So each step reports one of three states. `ok` means it was verified. `missing` means
it was verified as absent, with the exact command to fix it. `unknown` means only you
can tell us — you get asked, and if you are not there to answer nothing is assumed.
